# StackBall

This project is an implementation of the popular hypercasual game genre where you control a ball, guiding it to break through a series of obstacles stacked below.

## Game Overview

In this game, your mission is to guide the ball safely through the descending helix tower by tapping/clicking and holding to make the ball move downward. The ball smashes through platforms and obstacles as it descends, aiming to reach the bottom.
